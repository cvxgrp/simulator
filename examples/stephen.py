# The simulator should always be completely agnostic as to the trading policy.
# You should even demonstrate this with silly policies.
# Like hereâ€™s one:  Each day choose names from the universe at random.
# Buy one (say 0.1 of your portfolio wealth) and short one the same amount.
# Not a good strategy, but a valid one.
# Of course the simulate will terminate if you go bust (which seems likely).
