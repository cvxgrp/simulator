A simple yet powerful simulator for investment strategies and portfolio backtesting.

Given a universe of $m$ assets we are given prices for each of them at
time $t_1, t_2, \ldots t_n$, e.g. we operate using an $n \times m$ matrix where
each column corresponds to a particular asset.

In a backtest we iterate in time (e.g. row by row) through the matrix and
allocate positions to all or some of the assets. This tool helps to
simplify the accounting. It keeps track of the available cash,
the profits achieved, etc.

## üì• Installation

Install cvxsimulator via pip:

```bash
pip install cvxsimulator
```

## üìä Creating Portfolios

The simulator is completely agnostic to the trading policy/strategy.
Our approach follows a rather common pattern:

- [Create the builder object](#create-the-builder-object)
- [Loop through time](#loop-through-time)
- [Build the portfolio](#build-the-portfolio)

We demonstrate these steps with simple example policies.
They are never good strategies, but are always valid ones.

### Create the builder object

The user defines a builder object by loading prices
and initializing the amount of cash used in an experiment:

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> # For doctest, we'll create a small DataFrame instead of reading from a file
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>> b = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
```

Prices have to be valid, there may be NaNs only at the beginning and the end of
each column in the frame.
There can be no NaNs hiding in the middle of any time series.

It is also possible to specify a model for trading costs.
The builder helps to fill up the frame of positions. Only once done
we construct the actual portfolio.

### Loop through time

We have overloaded the `__iter__` and `__setitem__` methods to create a custom loop.
Let's start with a first strategy. Each day we choose two names from the
universe at random.
Buy one (say 0.1 of your portfolio wealth) and short one the same amount.

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>> b = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>> np.random.seed(42)  # Set seed for reproducibility
>>>
>>> for t, state in b:
...     # pick two assets deterministically for doctest
...     pair = ['A', 'B']  # Use first two assets instead of random choice
...     # compute the pair
...     units = pd.Series(index=state.assets, data=0.0)
...     units[pair] = [state.nav, -state.nav] / state.prices[pair].values
...     # update the position
...     b.position = 0.1 * units
...     # Do not apply trading costs
...     b.aum = state.aum
>>>
>>> # Check the final positions
>>> b.units.iloc[-1][['A', 'B']]
A     951.409346
B   -1884.867573
Name: 2020-01-05 00:00:00, dtype: float64
>>>
```

Here t is the growing list of timestamps, e.g. in the first iteration
t is $t1$, in the second iteration it will be $t1, t2$ etc.

A lot of magic is hidden in the state variable.
The state gives access to the currently available cash, the current prices
and the current valuation of all holdings.

Here's a slightly more realistic loop. Given a set of $4$ assets we want to
implement the popular $1/n$ strategy.

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>>
>>> b2 = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
>>> for t, state in b2:
...     # each day we invest a quarter of the capital in the assets
...     b2.position = 0.25 * state.nav / state.prices
...     b2.aum = state.aum
>>>
>>> # Check the final positions
>>> b2.units.iloc[-1]
A    2508.939034
B    4970.539596
C    1254.469517
D    3334.665805
Name: 2020-01-05 00:00:00, dtype: float64
>>>
```

Note that we update the position at the last element in the t list
using a series of actual units rather than weights or cashpositions.
The builder class also exposes setters for such alternative conventions.

```python
>>> # Setup code for this example
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>>
>>> b3 = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
>>> for t, state in b3:
...     # each day we invest a quarter of the capital in the assets
...     b3.weights = np.ones(4)*0.25
...     b3.aum = state.aum
>>>
>>> # Check the final positions
>>> b3.units.iloc[-1]
A    2508.939034
B    4970.539596
C    1254.469517
D    3334.665805
Name: 2020-01-05 00:00:00, dtype: float64
>>>
```

### Build the portfolio

Once finished it is possible to build the portfolio object:

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>>
>>> b3 = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
>>> for t, state in b3:
...     b3.weights = np.ones(4)*0.25
...     b3.aum = state.aum
>>>
>>> # Build the portfolio from one of our builders
>>> portfolio = b3.build()
>>>
>>> # Verify the portfolio was created successfully
>>> type(portfolio).__name__
'Portfolio'
>>>
```

## üìà Analytics

The portfolio object supports further analysis and exposes
a number of properties, e.g.:

```python
>>> # Setup code for this example
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>>
>>> b3 = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
>>> for t, state in b3:
...     b3.weights = np.ones(4)*0.25
...     b3.aum = state.aum
>>> portfolio = b3.build()
>>>
>>> # Access portfolio properties
>>> len(portfolio.nav)  # Length of the NAV series
5
>>> portfolio.nav.name  # Name of the NAV series
'NAV'
>>>
>>> # Check the equity (positions in cash terms)
>>> portfolio.equity.shape
(5, 4)
>>>
```

It is possible to generate a snapshot of the portfolio:

```python
>>> # Setup code for this example
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cvx.simulator import Builder
>>>
>>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=5)
>>> prices = pd.DataFrame({
...     'A': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105],
...     'B': [50, 51, 52, 51, 53],
...     'C': [200, 202, 198, 205, 210],
...     'D': [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
... }, index=dates)
>>>
>>> b3 = Builder(prices=prices, initial_aum=1e6)
>>>
>>> for t, state in b3:
...     b3.weights = np.ones(4)*0.25
...     b3.aum = state.aum
>>> portfolio = b3.build()
>>>
>>> # Generate a snapshot (returns a plotly figure)
>>> fig = portfolio.snapshot()
>>>
>>> # For doctest, we'll just check the type of the returned object
>>> isinstance(fig, object)
True
>>>
```
