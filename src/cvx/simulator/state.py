Portfolio state management for the CVX Simulator.

during simulation. It tracks positions, prices, cash, and other portfolio metrics,
and is updated by the Builder class during the simulation process.

    Represents the current state of a portfolio during simulation.

    The State class tracks the current positions, prices, cash, and other metrics
    of a portfolio at a specific point in time. It is updated within a loop by the
    Builder class during the simulation process.

    The class provides properties for accessing various portfolio metrics like
    cash, NAV, value, weights, and leverage. It also provides setter methods
    for updating the portfolio state (aum, cash, position, prices).

    _time : datetime
        Current time in the simulation
    _days : int
