        This little exercise goes back to an idea by Stephen Boyd:

        The simulator should always be completely agnostic as to the trading policy.
        You should even demonstrate this with silly policies.
        Like hereâ€™s one:  Each day choose names from the universe at random.
        Buy one (say 0.1 of your portfolio wealth) and short one the same amount.
        Not a good strategy, but a valid one.
        Of course the simulate will terminate if you go bust (which seems likely).
