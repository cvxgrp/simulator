"""1/n portfolio strategies implemented using the CVX simulator.

This module demonstrates various implementations of the 1/n portfolio strategy,
where equal weights are assigned to all assets in the portfolio. It explores
different approaches to constructing and optimizing such portfolios:

1. Simple equal weighting with daily rebalancing
2. Formulating the problem as a convex optimization using different objectives:
   - Minimization of the Euclidean norm of weights
   - Minimization of the infinity norm of weights
   - Maximization of the entropy of weights
   - Minimization of tracking error to a 1/n target
3. Sparse updating strategy that only rebalances when the portfolio drifts
   significantly from the target weights

Each approach is implemented and visualized to compare performance.

    # The 1/n family

    We play with the $1/n$ portfolio. We start with a vanilla implementation using daily rebalancing.
    Every portfolio should be the solution of a convex optimization problem,
    see https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stock-picking-convex-programs-thomas-schmelzer.
    We do that and show methods to construct the portfolio with

    * the minimization of the Euclidean norm of the weights.
    * the minimization of the $\infty$ norm of the weights.
    * and the maximization of the Entropy of the weights.
    * the minimization of the tracking error to an $1/n$ portfolio.

    We also play with sparse updates, e.g. rather than rebalancing daily,
    we act only once the deviation of our drifted portfolio got too large from the target $1/n$ portfolio.

    This problem has been discussed https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7149432321388064768/
